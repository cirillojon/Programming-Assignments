Runtime-Analysis

There are potentially 8 choices for a given value. ( up, down, right, left, diagonal up right, diagonal down left , 
diagonal down right, diagonal up right). So given a string length len, for each character in the string,
search will run 8 times. So this gives us 8^len. But, we must also account for the rows and columns in the matrix.
In the worst case, this algorithm will run 8 times for each row and column for each letter in the given word.
This gives us a final worst case runtime of:

O(rows * columns * 8^len)

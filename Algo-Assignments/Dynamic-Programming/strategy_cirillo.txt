Testing Strategy:


The test strategy is to try and force the algorithm to make a mistake by giving it tricky test cses.
Test case two is tricky because the value needs to be updated after realizing 9 is larger than 2. 

Test Case 1:
5 
9 3 5 7 3 
5 8 1 4 5 


9+8+5+4+3 = 29, therefore the correct output should be 29, as this is the largest sum given the set restrictions.

Test Case 2:
3 
1 2 9 
10 1 1 

10 + 9 = 19, therefore the correct output should be 19, as this is the largest sum given the set restrictions.

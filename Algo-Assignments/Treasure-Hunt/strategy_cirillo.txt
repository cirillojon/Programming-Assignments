I used the website https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/ to create the test cases and ensure that the output 
was being generated correctly. This website has a very helpful graph_editor feature that allows to build the graphs. 


Correct output for the test cases - 

Test Case 1:
In city: 3
On the road: 6

Test Case 2:
For test case 2:
In city: 2
On the road: 2
